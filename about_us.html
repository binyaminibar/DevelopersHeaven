	We are Brody and Bar, two industrial and engineering students from Afeka College in Tel Aviv. As a part of our final project, we are providing a solution for programmers and developers all over the world through our platform.

	As students ourselves, we understand the importance of finding the right career path in software and development. We know how much time and effort people invest in researching and finding the right education and job opportunities, and we want to make that process easier.

	Our platform includes a variety of tools and applications for those seeking guidance for a position in the field of development and programming, as well as for recruiters in organizations. We are using Microsoft Web Expression 4 to build a website that will be accessible on desktop and mobile devices.

	We are also using statistical tools and data mining techniques to provide our users with insights and recommendations on what tools, abilities, and education they need to acquire in order to reach their desired career goals. We are presenting this information in a user-friendly and easily accessible way, so that everyone can benefit from it.

	As we continue to work on the project, we are also exploring potential revenue streams, including displaying advertisements. Ultimately, our goal is to streamline the recruitment process and help people find their dream job in the field of development and programming.

We are excited about the possibilities of our project and the impact it can have on the industry. Thank you for taking the time to learn more about us and our solution.
